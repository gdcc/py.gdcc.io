The source for https://py.gdcc.io, the website for the pyDataverse Working Group.

## Contributing

Before committing changes to the website, build it locally to make sure everything looks fine with:

```
bundle install
```

Then run the server with:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should be able to see the site at <http://localhost:4000>

If you prefer running the site in Docker, you can try this:

```
./run.sh
```
